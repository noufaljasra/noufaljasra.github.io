> ## Project Summary :
__MAIN PROJECT
➢ Topic: CFD studies to obtain optimal attitudes and relative spacing of airfoil in a PRANDTL WING
➢ Research Center: Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC), ISRO, Thumba, Trivandrum, Kerala.
➢ Project Objective and Description: This Project describes the importance of reducing induced drag built-up due to tip vortices which are caused by the lift produced by the aircraft wings. So a Prandtl wing is designed and obtained the optimal attitude and relative spacing of airfoils in a 2D Prandtl wing. The software used for analysis is Ansys Fluent.
